            Simon Fraser Career is the career department of Simon Fraser University. Big Fair Documentary is the conclusion of the video sets, which includes SAP, Sky Box Lab, Stemcell Technology and Camp Pacific. The purpose of those four documentaries is promoting the company in the big fair event. The companies are using those video to introduce themselves to the students. I work with my club members in this project. I am the vice president of the Simon Fraser Cinematography. In this project, I take a role as the director, cameraman, editor and light guider in this project.
            <br><br><br>
            After accepting the project from SFU Career we have several meeting with both SFU crews and the company representative, which make sure our storyboard and interview question is perfectly reasonable and preservative. After that, we took almost 3 days filming the interview and the B-roll. I spent 2 weeks on editing the footage, which including rough cut, colour grading and final delivery. During the editing process, we meet the company represents several times to confirm the material.
